This code also details steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe space for everybody.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Why have this Code of Conduct?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the eLife Innovation Sprint is to drive change in research communication and culture through the development of open tools and prototypes and bringing a community of passionate innovators together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our event, projects and community gain strength from diversity. We believe that Sprint prototypes and tools will benefit from creativity and ideas from a diverse group of contributors, and that our community members can best learn and grow through sharing with and listening to folks with diverse perspectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We prioritise creating a space and platform that is <strong>safe and productive for everyone in the Sprint community<\/strong>, regardless of their background, family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race and\/or ethnicity, caste, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, physical appearance, geographical location, work experience, or any other dimension of diversity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recognise that if people experience harassment, and\/or feel unsafe or unwelcome, it can jeopardise their ability to work and participate in the Sprint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this Code of Conduct, we expect all attendees at the Sprint to help create and maintain a safe and productive space, and prevent and avoid behaviours that will make people feel unsafe or unwelcome. We ask all participants to join us in supporting and empowering others to contribute responsibly in a way that lifts others up, and to protect (where possible) the people who help us to do this by using and supporting the enactment of this Code of Conduct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What is it not?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>This code of conduct does not replace existing legal mechanisms.

The Safety Team will also assess whether there is sufficient information to determine whether the report constitutes a Code of Conduct violation, and\/or for the Safety Team to make a decision on actions. In the case where there is insufficient information, the Safety Team may contact the reporter, reported or any other attendees to obtain more information.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once additional information is gathered, the Safety Team will collectively review and decide on the best course of action to take, if any.
